1. Fit a GAM with whatever variables you’re interested in/want to adjust for (ignoring within-subject correlation)
2. Extract the model matrix from the GAM
3. Use the columns in the GAM model matrix to fit a GEE, specifying subject ID and assuming exchangeable correlation structure
4. Jointly test whether the coefficients of the smooth terms are 0

The example I wrote wasn’t for repeated measures- I think it was just a case where there were multiple ways of quantifying something for each person so we wanted to account for within-subject correlation. Let me know if I can clarify anything!
