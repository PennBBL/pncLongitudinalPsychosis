# Longitudinal Trajectories of Psychosis Spectrum Youth

This repository contains a series of analyses for projects led by Drs. Ruben C. Gur and Raquel E. Gur about predicting psychosis, and delineating longitudinal trajectories who, at various points in time, were identified as being on the psychosis spectrum. The analyses will most likely be split into a series of papers:

1. Environmental and genetic risk factors,
2. Cognitive trajectories,
3. Clinical and functional trajectories,
4. Structural (e.g., volume, cortical thickness, GMD) trajectories, and
5. Emotion identification activation trajectories.
